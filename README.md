# cppNES

A work in progress at the moment, but the repository page feels lonely without a README. 
Here's a succinct explanation of my motivations and what I will accomplish here

## Why Emulate the NES

To learn about computer architecture? Nah, 6502's have come and gone for most programmers (although it is very interesting stuff). Did I start this project because I just really like the NES? Not exactly, but close. 

I am fascinated with early video game design, and the architecture behind the machines that made it possible. Some of the early video games were so closely tied to the hardware, you could [inject code into a game by manipulating patterns on the screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9zJ8GA6fEo).

## Hopes for the Project

My hope is to finish the project, and iteratively improve on it as I learn more about software design and NES architecture. I'm not sure that I'll get around to implementing all 256 memory mappers, but I'll work on it until it is something I can be proud of.
